  <b>🏢OfficeCelebr8🎉</b> is a fun, as well as, helpful web application built on Angular and ASP.NET Core, made for your fellow colleagues who forgets to contribute in events. In this application, you can create a <i>room</i> where one can add members/colleagues, with a set of amount to be contributed between those members, to meet up with the total. You can create rooms for someone's birthday, event party, farewell, welcoming event, and basically anything which needs contribution of money💸.
